# SP-Design.github.io
If you need to make changes, clone this repo to your computer & do what you need to do. 
To upload it again to the GitHub repo (to take effect on the live site), you can either download the GitHub app & commit/push that way, or on the command line (if you're using windows, download cmder), 'cd' into your local repo that you cloned and type: 

'git add .'

'git commit -m "commit message here"'

'git push origin master'
    
If that doesn't work, you may need to run 'git remote add origin https://github.com/SP-Design/SP-Design.github.io.git' first.

Any issues, give Mertie a shout.
