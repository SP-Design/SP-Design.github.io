        <p>Enthusiastic spontaneity, is a collaborative term I like to use when explaining my creative style, process or even personality. I've found this trait continually allows me the chance and desire to experience as much as I can and to remind me to always stay open to learning something new; it helps adjust how I work and the outcome of my work, depending on the medium, in both digital and traditional artisan.
            <br />
            <br /> Sometimes a more innovative and calculated approach that stays in the rules of design is demanded/required; others, I don’t hold back, just get to work with no plan of action, left alone to spontaneously create, as this vivid and nonsensical idea puts itself together in my head and just see what happens; I think that’s the key to really unveiling what you believe, think and feel, when you put rules and cautions aside and let emotion take over, to blindly create something to the point when even you don’t expect the end result.
            <br />
            <br /> However I think having a collective mindset within both of these attitudes allows for a better understanding in being able to differentiate what approach is required, whether it be for me personally or a future client.
